<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I'm an IT student at SLIIT with a strong passion for technology and innovation. Alongside my studies, I work on various IT projects to build my skills and gain real-world experience. When I'm not immersed in tech, 
  you can usually find me enjoying sports, staying active, and connecting with friends. I love celebrating milestones and good times with those around me. Always eager to learn and grow, 
  I'm excited about what the future holds in both the tech and social aspects of life!
